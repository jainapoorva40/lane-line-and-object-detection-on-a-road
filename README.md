# lane-line-detection

The OpenCV Lane Line and Object Detection project involves building a computer vision application that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect lane lines and objects in real-time video streams. The application aims to enhance driver assistance systems by providing visual cues about lane boundaries and identifying objects on the road.
